          My name is Julio Quintero I am from Venezuela, but I have been living
          in Houston for around 9 years now. You may remember me from CS-3304
          Data and Information Structures. I took that class almost 2 years ago!
          I am graduating this upcoming semester, and I am very glad I am taking
          one of your classes before finishing college. This semester seems to
          be a little more organized than the last one and I hope that this
          whole situation with Covid-19 comes to an end. Having said that, I
          have enjoyed my time at home and working on school work. I have also
          started to work out again since April, and I have also practice
          programming during these difficult times. This introduction is short
          so it is not much for me to say without running out of 200 words.
          Thus, all I will say is that I am looking forward to the rest of the
          homewards, projects, and lectures, as well as the W-course assignment
          that you will give later in the semester. I always recommend your
          courses to all new students because you are one of the few teachers
          who is not scary like the rest. See you in class!
